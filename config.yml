# Auto Responses Settings
# ==============================================

# You can add as many triggers as you want, each will be tried in order
# For each trigger, the bot will check if the message matches the condition
# If the message matches, the bot will send a response

# The condition can be one of the following:
# - startswith: The message starts with the specified text (case-insensitive)
# - exact: The message is exactly the specified text (case-insensitive)
# - endswith: The message ends with the specified text (case-insensitive)
# - contains: The message contains the specified text (case-insensitive)
# - strict: The message is exactly the specified text (case-sensitive)

# The separator config is used to format the detected input inside the response.
# It helps highlight the detected word or phrase in the response.
# Recommended options include:
# - "`" for inline code formatting
# - "**" for bold text formatting
# - "*" for italic text formatting

# The ignoreMembers option is an array of user IDs that should be ignored
# If a user is in the array, the bot will not send a response to them

# The ignoreRoles option is an array of role IDs that should be ignored
# If a user has at least one of the roles in the array, the bot will not send a response to them
# If the ignoreRoles array is empty, this feature will be disabled

# The requiredRoles option is an array of role IDs that are required to trigger the response
# If a user does not have at least one of the roles, the bot will not send a response to them

# This section is for users who host the bot in a limited environment without write access to a logs.txt file.
# Enabling the option below and adding a channel ID will mean the bot will send errors that were supposed to go to logs.txt into that channel instead.
# Please make sure the channel ID you add below is that of a private and secure channel, not a public one.
